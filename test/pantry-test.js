// what data will i need to run these tests?
// ğŸ§ª the pantry will need ingredients - these will be supplied by the user
// ğŸ§ª recipe to check for necessary ingredients
//
// Create classes and methods that can:
// ğŸ§ª Determine whether a userâ€™s pantry has enough ingredients to cook a given meal.
  // ğŸ§ª check the pantry for each ingredient
  // ğŸ§ª  if any of the ingredients are not present, return an error
  // ğŸ§ª  if all of the ingredients are present, the receipe/meal can be made
//
//ğŸ§ª  Determine the amount of missing ingredients still needed to cook a given meal, based on whatâ€™s in the userâ€™s pantry.
//
//ğŸ§ª  Remove the ingredients used to cook a given recipe from a userâ€™s pantry.

// User Stories
// As a user, I should be able to view what ingredients exist inside of my pantry.
  // pantry.userPantry
// As a user, I should be able to check my list of recipes to cook and see if my pantry has enough ingredients to cook a meal.
  // pantry.checkForIngr()
// As a user, I should be told what ingredients are still needed if I donâ€™t have enough ingredients in my pantry to cook the recipe.
  // pantry.checkForIngr() ğŸ˜¢ sad path testing
// As a user, I should be able to cook a meal if I do have enough ingredients in my pantry. As a result, cooking the meal should remove the ingredients from my pantry.
  // pantry.removeIngr()
